# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

BoomBikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes using linear model.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
3. Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.
